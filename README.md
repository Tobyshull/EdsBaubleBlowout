# Ed The Elf's Baubles Blow Out

You start off in your house, and walk into the village where you are greeted by some dude explaining that mutant baubles (that look like the M&M characters) are going to invade the village from the local cave if you don't stop them. He gives you a candy cane "it's dangerous to go alone, take this" and sends you on your way.

There are different levels, the first is the forest before the cave, the next are different depths of the cave (shown by different colours) and the final level is found in the lab that created the mutant baubles which will have the final boss: David's head on a bauble. After you clear each level you will reach a checkpoint covered in tinsel that will save your progress in the cave for the next time you attack it.

You have limited stamina which will go down with the time of day, this will require you to go back to your house sleep through the night. You can also buy energy drinks from one of the shops in the village to get you through the last bit of a level if necessary.

Other things:
- There will also be a daily paddy's puzzle on a pin board in the village that can give you extra pigs in blankets for spending on weapons, health potions, energy drinks or decorations.
- Customisable elf character
- The person who sells weapons is a rogue bauble that wears an eye patch and trench coat
- One of the enemies can suddenly become jacks face
